# Symbol Validation Fix - MATIC-USDT Issue

## Problem Summary
The trading bot was trying to access `MATIC-USDT` which doesn't exist on BingX. The correct symbol is `POL-USDT` (Polygon rebranded MATIC to POL).

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Symbol Doesn't Exist**: MATIC-USDT is not available on BingX
2. **Token Rebranding**: MATIC was rebranded to POL (Polygon)  
3. **No Symbol Mapping**: The bot had no mechanism to handle deprecated/renamed symbols
4. **Static Symbol Lists**: Hardcoded symbol lists contained outdated symbols

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Symbol Mapping System ✅
Added `SYMBOL_MAPPING` to handle deprecated symbols:
```typescript
const SYMBOL_MAPPING: { [key: string]: string } = {
  'MATIC-USDT': 'POL-USDT', // MATIC was rebranded to POL (Polygon)
  'MATIC': 'POL-USDT',
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Symbol Validator ✅
Updated `validateAndFormatSymbol()` to check mappings first:
- Checks symbol mapping before processing
- Logs mapping actions for transparency
- Falls back to original logic if no mapping exists

### 3. Updated Popular Symbols List ✅
Changed hardcoded symbol lists:
- `'MATIC-USDT'` → `'POL-USDT'`
- Prevents 404 errors during market overview fetching

## Available Symbols Verified
- **POL-USDT**: ✅ Available (Polygon)
- **POLYX-USDT**: ✅ Available (Polymesh) 
- **MATIC-USDT**: ❌ Not available (deprecated)

## Error Code 109400
This is BingX's error code for "symbol not exist" - now resolved through proper symbol mapping.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with `MATIC` input → should map to `POL-USDT`
2. Test with `MATIC-USDT` input → should map to `POL-USDT`
3. Verify market overview no longer includes MATIC-USDT errors
4. Monitor logs for symbol mapping notifications

## Future Maintenance
Add more symbol mappings as tokens get rebranded or deprecated.
